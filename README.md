# Project_1

This project is meant to analyze the trend of Metaverse concept by looking at the Google Search Trend Analysis, using python to visually analyze Metaverse tweets data found on Kaggle.com, as well as using python Yahoo Finance API to generate stock perfomance data from the top 10 holdings in the first Metaverse ETF-Roundhill. Please note We excluded Amazon.com from the top 10 holding because Amazon.com's high stock price makes it hard to compare to other stocks at lower prices; instead, we included the 11th largest holding in the ETF, which is Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd.
